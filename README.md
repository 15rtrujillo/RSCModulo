Hello there.

This is my attempt at writing a RuneScape Classic shell client that uses the mudclient 235 network protocol. This means that, were RuneScape Classic still around, you could technically connect to the live game server with this client. This client is not intended to be a bot, and will not support scripts. This client is intended to merely be a way to play the game in a different manner (hopefully saving your wrist in the process). Ideally, when completed, you will be able to send commands to an 235-compatable RSC server with text commands instead of mouse clicks. The game will probably end up feeling like one of those old text adventure games.

If you're wondering about the name, I picked it to play off the RSC[math operator] naming scheme that a couple other RSC-related projects use. Basically, RSC% is the "remainder" of RSC that you get when you "divide" out the graphics.

I plan on mostly working on this project on my own. Eventually I'll add a open source license once I figure out which one is a good fit for this project so that others can contribute if they want.

This project is for educational purposes. I don't own RuneScape, nor am I affiliated with Jagex in any way.
