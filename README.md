Hello there.

This is my attempt at writing a RuneScape Classic shell client that uses the mudclient 235 network protocol. This is not a bot, merely a way to play the game in a different way (hopefully saving your wrist in the process).

This is for educational purposes only. I don't own RuneScape, nor am I affiliated with Jagex in any way.

Made by Ryan.
